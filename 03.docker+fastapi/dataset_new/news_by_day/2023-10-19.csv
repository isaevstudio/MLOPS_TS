Alcoa Declares $0.10 Dividend
On July 27, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share ($0.40 annualized). Shareholders of record as of August 8, 2023 received the payment on August 24, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.10 per share.
At the current share price of $24.23 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 1.65%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 1.67%, the lowest has been 0.43%, and the highest has been 7.05%. The standard deviation of yields is 1.15 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 0.02 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is -0.08. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is -0.20%.
