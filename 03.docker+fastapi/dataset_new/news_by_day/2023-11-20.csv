For the SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Value ETF (Symbol: MDYV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $75.92 per unit.
With MDYV trading at a recent price near $66.15 per unit, that means that analysts see 14.76% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of MDYV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA), Greif Inc (Symbol: GEF), and Gentex Corp. (Symbol: GNTX). Although AA has traded at a recent price of $26.22/share, the average analyst target is 16.90% higher at $30.65/share. Similarly, GEF has 16.60% upside from the recent share price of $68.61 if the average analyst target price of $80.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting GNTX to reach a target price of $35.67/share, which is 15.42% above the recent price of $30.90. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of AA, GEF, and GNTX:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Value ETF MDYV $66.15 $75.92 14.76%
Alcoa Corporation AA $26.22 $30.65 16.90%
Greif Inc GEF $68.61 $80.00 16.60%
Gentex Corp. GNTX $30.90 $35.67 15.42%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.
